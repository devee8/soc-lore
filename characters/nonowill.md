## Bond Tale: Lost Flute

MC finds NonoWill lost in throught in Elysium.  MC gives NonoWill her flute which MC retrieved from the Sea of Chaos. This is NonoWill's favorite flute and brings back many happy memories, including those she shared in the town of Convallaria with the MC.  NonoWill thanks MC for expending the effort to find her flute in the Sea of Chaos.

NonoWill confirms that this version of herself in Elysium is the NonoWill that died. She may be speaking of the event in which the Vlde were betrayed by Dantalion and enslaved by the Elaman, after which NonoWill was found at the brink of death and later perished.

NonoWill laments that upon entering Elysium she still felt resentment and regret because of what happened. She wasn't able to face MC because of that.

NonoWill says that when she looks back now she can start to understand the situation MC was in and how hopeless their situation was. She starts to feel that she can let go of the pain that she's been holding onto.  She says that she should not blame MC who was only trying to selflessly help others.

NonoWill comes to the conclusion that she should be more cautious.  It's no use regretting what has happened and she wants to focus on the future.

## Bond Tale: Vlderian Song

NonoWill sings the song she sang on the hill of Convallaria. She then speaks with the MC and says that the lyrics are about affection and longing in which the hero in the song was unable to meet with the one he longed for.

NonoWill then hopes that the Sea of Chaos could grant wishes and that she could have her wishes granted. She observes that even though the MC is powerful it's been hard to protect Elysium. She hopes to become strong so that she can help the MC.

NonoWill then speaks alone.  She says that since coming to Elysium she has wanted to write a song, but could not.  She wonders if it is because she didn't have her flute and also confesses that she doesn't have the courage to tell MC her feelings. She resolves to do so after her song is finished, hoping her song will show MC how she feels.
