# Homa

## Biography

Homa is an Elaman merchant who has 3 parrots. She gets out of trouble using her street smarts or luck. Those that interact with Homa find her to be warm and approachable, but she is also mysterious.

On the surface Homa appears to be a normal merchant trading in normal goods between Elaman and Iria. However she is actually taking part in underground trading for certain reasons. Her trade depends on a network of contacts that she has made.

Homa claims that she has a partnership with her parrots, the backstory of which has yet to be uncovered.

## Bond Story: Reasons to Stay Busy

Homa is talking to the Main Character in Elysium.  MC says they rarely see Homa and her birds indoors recently. Homa asks MC if they are missing them with Barul the red parrot copying what Homa says. MC asks Homa what she's been up to and Homa says she's been wandering around and fighting the Calamity. Barul says he is tired and worn out. Homa then gives Barul a biscuit and Barul is happy. MC is concerned about Homa's well-being but Homa says she is okay.

Homa then says perhaps one reason she and the parrots don't stay around the house so much is because the parrots are not used to Cat.  She says the cat makes chattering sounds when the parrots are in the trees. MC acknowledges that is the case and Homa says the parrots were so scared they almost peed. Barul laughs at that. MC says they will talk to the cat.

In reality that was just a cover story.  After MC leaves Barul says "liar liar". Homa says that she can't just tell the truth like that. The truth is that Homa was helping someone defeat more Calamity. She comments that as long as she's got biscuits the parrots shouldn't have a problem. Barul agrees.

## Homa Character Trial

Homa is at a checkpoint inspecting goods.  She is working for a smuggler.  The smuggler notices that some of his goods are gone.  Homa took them and "forgot" to log them.  She then charges the smuggler additional shipping fees for the high-risk items that were not logged.  The smuggler instead threatens to sell Homa on the slave market and commands his men to get Homa and the goods. Fighting alongside a Recruited Pikeman Homa fends off the attackers.

After defeating the attackers Homa comments that they should have paid up.  She then calls Baloor, Goli and Shahin and leaves.
