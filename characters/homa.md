# Homa

## Biography

Homa is an Elaman merchant who has 3 parrots. She gets out of trouble using her street smarts or luck. Those that interact with Homa find her to be warm and approachable, but she is also mysterious.

On the surface Homa appears to be a normal merchant trading in normal goods between Elaman and Iria. However she is actually taking part in underground trading for certain reasons. Her trade depends on a network of contacts that she has made.

Homa claims that she has a partnership with her parrots, the backstory of which has yet to be uncovered.

## Bond Story: Reasons to Stay Busy

Homa is talking to the Main Character in Elysium.  MC says they rarely see Homa and her birds indoors recently. Homa asks MC if they are missing them with Barul the red parrot copying what Homa says. MC asks Homa what she's been up to and Homa says she's been wandering around and fighting the Calamity. Barul says he is tired and worn out. Homa then gives Barul a biscuit and Barul is happy. MC is concerned about Homa's well-being but Homa says she is okay.

Homa then says perhaps one reason she and the parrots don't stay around the house so much is because the parrots are not used to Cat.  She says the cat makes chattering sounds when the parrots are in the trees. MC acknowledges that is the case and Homa says the parrots were so scared they almost peed. Barul laughs at that. MC says they will talk to the cat.

In reality that was just a cover story.  After MC leaves Barul says "liar liar". Homa says that she can't just tell the truth like that. The truth is that Homa was helping someone defeat more Calamity. She comments that as long as she's got biscuits the parrots shouldn't have a problem. Barul agrees.

## Homa Character Trial

Homa is at a checkpoint inspecting goods.  She is working for a smuggler.  The smuggler notices that some of his goods are gone.  Homa took them and "forgot" to log them.  She then charges the smuggler additional shipping fees for the high-risk items that were not logged.  The smuggler instead threatens to sell Homa on the slave market and commands his men to get Homa and the goods. Fighting alongside a Recruited Pikeman Homa fends off the attackers.

After defeating the attackers Homa comments that they should have paid up.  She then calls Baloor, Goli and Shahin and leaves.

## A Fighting Night in Beryland: Wondrous Fair

Homa is talking to MC in Elysium. Homa was sent by Beryl to get MC. She shows MC a message from Beryl that says "My scret hideout's open, just this once! Got loads of games ready! Lucky you, getting my invite." This is an invitation to Beryl's Paradise. Homa tells MC everyone is waiting and if they are ready to go. 

### Act I

MC arrives. In the group there is Cocoa, Maitha, Agata, Guzman, Acambe, Samantha, Garcia, Miguel, Beyrl and Gloria. Cat is sleeping on a chair. Cocoa is standing in front of a chest wondering how there are theives in Elysium. The chest looks like a refrigerator. Garcia says theives are not surprising since there will always be people wanting to leech off others. Miguel asks why she is staring at him since he wouldn't want that junk anyway. Samantha asks Cocoa if she is sure she put the stuff in the safe. Cocoa says she is sure because only that chest can hold her iron pot. The iron pot was stolen. But then MC spots the pot. Miguel comments that he was almost blamed for something he didn't do. Beryl tells Cocoa not to worry since she often forgets stuff too, like if she's added ingredients or not. Cocoa says it's not her fault and that her pot was covered in old grease implying that this pot isn't hers. Miguel comments that who else but Cocoa would be carrying around a cauldron in Elysium. 

Cocoa then remembers that before she put the pot in the chest she said, "I want a new pot". She thinks the chest is magic just like at amusement parks. Miguel tells Cocoa to stop trying to fool everyone. Cocoa tells him to try it.  Beryl wants to try it out since it's not like it's going to explode.

Beryl takes a bottl of "Volcano Gurgle Secret Strenth Potion" that they used before and puts it into the chest. Garcia says that name is cheesy. Something happens in the chest and when they look at the bottle it's empty. Beryl is mad because she didn't ask for empty bottles. Cocoa thinks a bit and asks Beryl if it is possible the potion in the bottle went back to Beryl just like Cocoa's iron pot appeared on Cocoa's back. Beryl says that's not possible since it would explode if it touches the air. As she says this something explodes on Beryl and she runs around. Beryl is mad since the explosion hurt and she didn't want to get exploded. Garcia asks Beryl why her potion was so weak? Miguel comments that if it were stronger Beryl would have been done for today. 

From this Cocoa exclaims that the box really is magic, but it's a strange magic. Agata says it's still to early to say. Cocoa ask if anyone else wants to give it a shot. Gloria steps up to the box and asks for a plate of grilled fish. A plate of grilled fish comes out of the box. Beryl says she wants some too. MC asks if someone's stomach is growling. It was Gloria. She says that's strange since she just had grilled fish. Beryl concludes that the box must have taken the fish from Gloria's belly. Agata then offers that the purpose of the chest is for "restoration". Gloria asks if that means things that were lost can be regained. 

Beryl then steps up to the box and asks for the restoration of the materials that were wasted in the experiment and for her pet Toughie to be back. A mechanical voice comes from the box saying that engery levels are below 20% and to confirm they want to drain all the energy. Cat looks on but doesn't say anything. Acambe suggests they evenly distribute the remaining uses. Agata wonders if there is enough energy to distribute for everyone's use. Beryl and Cocoa both comment they want to try it more. Agata suggests they let the victor make the final decision. MC asks what are the conditions to win? Agata proposes a match. Beryl wants to make the rules. Garcia complains that it's another competion and that they can't stick to the rules. Agata needles Garcia asking if Garcia doesn't want to participate or if she has nothing to wish for. Garcia gets mad. Maitha looks on but doesn't say anything. 

### Act II: Guarding Wishes 1

Homa calls MC "boss" and explains that in Hashalaram that's how they address employers, but it's also used to tease. Homa proposes to team up with MC. MC says the match is a solo showdown, but Homa says there isn't a rule that they can't strategize together. MC asks why Homa is helping him. Homa says it's Shahin's call. 

They participate in "The Great Magic Potion Battle" with Homa and her parrots assisting MC in the competion.  Samatha defeats Guzman. Miguel defeats Garcia. Gloria defeats Maitha. Cocoa and Acambe defeate each other. MC defeats Agata then Samantha, Miguel and Gloria. 

### Act III: Guarding Wishes 2

Miguel smells something awful. Cocoa spots a "tasty ingredient" moving on the ground. Beyrl says it's her pet chick and she is surprised it hatched. Miguel reveals the pet chick made a poo on him. Garcia jokes that Miguel is so maternal. Beyrl says the chick can join the next match.

The match is a potion battle with magical concoctions. Guzman, Cocoa and MC make up one team. Maitha, Garcia and Miguel make up another. In this battle Goli is able to steal effects from others, also Homa calls Goli a "her". Garcia defeats Cocoa. Miguel defeats Guzman. 

While fighting Maitha it's revealed that Homa can hear the thoughts of the parrots using a skill called perception. MC defeats Maitha.

Garcia teleports behind Miguel as if to attack him but she's just teasing and was just trying to cause a disruption. She teleports back. MC defeats Garcia.

Beryl releases her "Maid Wolf Mk II" into the field. MC uses perception on a wolf and finds out the were created to fight Calamity. When there is no Calamity Beryl forgets about them. Another wolf reveals they are in charge of cleaning the master's room but it never cleans rooms because it's the other wolves that make the mess. 

Using perception on Miguel MC finds out that while the chick smells bad he sort of likes it's fluffy touch. Miguel understands why Col likes fuzzy things. Miguel is defeated by MC and MC promises Goli cookies. 

Miguel tells Garcia she still lost the match. Garcia says she didn't join just to win. Cocoa notices that Beryl is no where to be seen. Agata says she saw Beryl head to Paradise. Samantha guesses she went to prepare something. MC notices Beryl has been missing since the start of the match. Homa appears and announces to everyone that Beryl has something important to tell them at Elysium. No one knows why, but Homa says judging by Beryl's expression it's not serious. 

### Act IV: 

Back at Paradise Beryl announces the winning team: Cocoa's team and Guzman scored a point. Cocoa asks Beryl where she went as Cocoa was chatting with her but then realized she was talking to Miguel. Beryl says she was getting ready for the next showdown but that she can't say what it is yet (this leads into Act IV which is time locked in-game).
