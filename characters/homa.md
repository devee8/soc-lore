## Homa Character Trial

Homa is at a checkpoint inspecting goods.  She is working for a smuggler.  The smuggler notices that some of his goods are gone.  Homa took them and "forgot" to log them.  She then charges the smuggler additional shipping fees for the high-risk items that were not logged.  The smuggler instead threatens to sell Homa on the slave market and commands his men to get Homa and the goods. Fighting alongside a Recruited Pikeman Homa fends off the attackers.

After defeating the attackers Homa comments that they should have paid up.  She then calls Baloor, Goli and Shahin and leaves.
