# Candlelight

Candlelight is the code name of one of the Hanged Men.  

Candlelight was assigned to guide and mentor Nungal and Nergal as they went through their trials to become part of the Hanged Men.

During their final mission Candlelight sacrificed his life to complete the mission.  This teaches Nungal and Nergal the lesson that the Hanged Men will complete their mission no matter what and that missions can often result in the loss of fellow Hanged Men.

Candlelight had a son and daughter.

We later meet Candlelight again, but this time it is the previous Candlelight's daughter.  We learn that the name Candlelight is a code name passed from one Hanged Man to another.
