## Biography

Sylvia was a Union Paladin that helped [Faris](./faris.md) overthrow the previous Iria government.  When Faris became king of Iria Sylvia became the queen.

Sylvia was the stepmother of [Dantalion](./dantalion.md), [Lutfi](./lutfi.md) and [Inanna](./inanna.md).  She was in their lives when they were young.

During an assassination attempt on King Faris, Sylvia was killed. Presumably it was [Auguste](./auguste.md) who killed her.  This resulted in Dantalion and Lutfi maaking a pact to enact revenge on Auguste.
