# Momo

## Biography

Momo is a Vlderian girl who was captured and experimented on by the Darklight's Tranquillo.  She underwent Tranquillo's [Luxite experiments](../events/luxite-experiments.md) that fused Luxite into subjects.

The experiments scarred Momo physically and possibly mentally but left her with Luxite powers and a darkness in her heart.

At some point Momo escaped Darklight and wandered around seemingly oblivious to her past and current situation. Socially she is often slow in responding and seems to be dazed and detatched.  It is unkown if this is how Momo has always been or if it's a product of the experiments.

While those that see Momo may feel sorry for her, he truth is she is content with her present life roaming and exploring the world.

## Elysium

In Elysium Momo appears to have an attachment to the main character.  While she does not appear to want to interact with other characters she does want to interact with the main character more.

In Elysium Momo is thinking to herself that she got caught again. Main Character asks her if she is used to living in Elysium.  Momo says she doesn't like it because she likes to be alone and crowded places makes her uncomfortable. She thinks to herself that even if she doesn't like it here the presence of MC calms her. MC says that perhaps she doesn't like crowded places because it reminds her of her past undergoing the cruel Darklight experiments. MC says it must have been painful, but Momo says she doesn't know. To Momo the experiments were like meals and showers, just common things that happened. She says it did hurt, but it doesn't matter. She got used to the needles and iron chains around her ankles. She got used to the screaming she heard from next door and that her body is different from others. Because she got used to those things she didn't feel upset. MC thinks to themselves that since she got used to those things that's why she is like this now. They tell Momo that she can trust others that care for her or she doesn't need to forcer herself to fit in.  MC says that in Elysium she is free from the pain of her past and hopes she can become used to life in Elysium. Momo says she will think about it since it's MC telling her this. 

After MC leaves Momo is by herself and says it's been a while since she started secretly monitoring them (MC). Her monitoring has become a habit just like the experiements in her past. She says she doesn't understand why they said those things to her and their expression also confuses her. She supposes this means they are getting closer and that she's feeling a bit better now after talking with them. Since she feels better she figures MC has some kind of magic power.
