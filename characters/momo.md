# Momo

## Biography

Momo is a Vlderian girl who was captured and experimented on by the Darklight's Tranquillo.  She underwent Tranquillo's [Luxite experiments](../events/luxite-experiments.md) that fused Luxite into subjects.

The experiments scarred Momo physically and possibly mentally but left her with Luxite powers and a darkness in her heart.

At some point Momo escaped Darklight and wandered around seemingly oblivious to her past and current situation. Socially she is often slow in responding and seems to be dazed and detatched.  It is unkown if this is how Momo has always been or if it's a product of the experiments.

While those that see Momo may feel sorry for her, he truth is she is content with her present life roaming and exploring the world.
