## Character Trial

Caris' character trial takes place in a church setting. A little girl and boy are being attacked by marauders. Around them people lay on the ground. The marauders burned down the entire town. A marauder mocks the children asking if they think Radiance will save them. 

A Papal Pikeman appears and tells the kids to get behind them. The Papal Pikeman is along against many marauders. The Papal Pikeman says that even if it means dying there they must protect the children and prays to Radiance to shield them. 

Caris then appears and sends a blast of energy across the sanctuary. The blast does not hit anyone, but a marauder moves away. Caris is accompanied by another Papal Pikeman and two Radiant Maidservants. She tells the two Radiant Maidservants to tend to the wounded. 

The first Papal Pikeman greets Caris as "Bishop Your Excellency". Caris tells the Papal Pikeman to protect the children and leave the marauders to her. She says she will not let innocents perish within the Sanctuary.  The Papal Pikman says they will not retreat as they also serve the Radiance. Caris accepts this and moves to fight the marauders with the Papal Pikmen's assistance. 

Caris and the Papal Pikemen defeat the marauders.
