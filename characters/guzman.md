# Guzman

## Biography

Guzman was a human who was experimented on by the Darklight's Tranquillo.  The [Luxite experiments](../events/luxite-experiments.md) Tranquillo performed on Guzman turned him into a monster that followed the Darklight's orders without question.

Guzman often switches between a passive state and a being of rage and madness.  He barely holds on to his former humanity.  When he does show signs of his former self it is often spent repeating his daughter's name.
