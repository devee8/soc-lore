# Alexei

## Biography

Alexei is the deputy leader of the Silver Wolf Mercenary Group and disciple of their leader [Agata](./agata.md).

As a Luccian Brutebear warrior Alexei can turn into a bear. 

Alexei admires those with strength and is eager to lear from them.  He is bold, valorous and loyal, but suffers from feelings of inadequacy.  Because of this he is unable to remain in bear form for long.

Although Alexei appears imposing he is still a young man inexperienced in the world.  Upon assuming a leadership position within the Silver Wolf Mercenary Group he strives to become both a stronger warrior and leader.

## Upon the Scorched Earth

In a battle Alexei is captured by [Simona](./simona.md).  The two enemies travel together for a bit before Simona knocks him out and lets him go.  They would later meet again in a pivotal battle.
