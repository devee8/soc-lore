# A Fighting Night in Beryland ~Wishes Beyond the Void~

## Event Theater: Wondrous Fair

Homa is talking to MC in Elysium. Homa was sent by Beryl to get MC. She shows MC a message from Beryl that says "My scret hideout's open, just this once! Got loads of games ready! Lucky you, getting my invite." This is an invitation to Beryl's Paradise. Homa tells MC everyone is waiting and if they are ready to go. 

### Act I

MC arrives. In the group there is Cocoa, Maitha, Agata, Guzman, Acambe, Samantha, Garcia, Miguel, Beryl and Gloria. Cat is sleeping on a chair. Cocoa is standing in front of a chest wondering how there are theives in Elysium. The chest looks like a refrigerator. Garcia says theives are not surprising since there will always be people wanting to leech off others. Miguel asks why she is staring at him since he wouldn't want that junk anyway. Samantha asks Cocoa if she is sure she put the stuff in the safe. Cocoa says she is sure because only that chest can hold her iron pot. The iron pot was stolen. But then MC spots the pot. Miguel comments that he was almost blamed for something he didn't do. Beryl tells Cocoa not to worry since she often forgets stuff too, like if she's added ingredients or not. Cocoa says it's not her fault and that her pot was covered in old grease implying that this pot isn't hers. Miguel comments that who else but Cocoa would be carrying around a cauldron in Elysium. 

Cocoa then remembers that before she put the pot in the chest she said, "I want a new pot". She thinks the chest is magic just like at amusement parks. Miguel tells Cocoa to stop trying to fool everyone. Cocoa tells him to try it.  Beryl wants to try it out since it's not like it's going to explode.

Beryl takes a bottl of "Volcano Gurgle Secret Strenth Potion" that they used before and puts it into the chest. Garcia says that name is cheesy. Something happens in the chest and when they look at the bottle it's empty. Beryl is mad because she didn't ask for empty bottles. Cocoa thinks a bit and asks Beryl if it is possible the potion in the bottle went back to Beryl just like Cocoa's iron pot appeared on Cocoa's back. Beryl says that's not possible since it would explode if it touches the air. As she says this something explodes on Beryl and she runs around. Beryl is mad since the explosion hurt and she didn't want to get exploded. Garcia asks Beryl why her potion was so weak? Miguel comments that if it were stronger Beryl would have been done for today. 

From this Cocoa exclaims that the box really is magic, but it's a strange magic. Agata says it's still to early to say. Cocoa ask if anyone else wants to give it a shot. Gloria steps up to the box and asks for a plate of grilled fish. A plate of grilled fish comes out of the box. Beryl says she wants some too. MC asks if someone's stomach is growling. It was Gloria. She says that's strange since she just had grilled fish. Beryl concludes that the box must have taken the fish from Gloria's belly. Agata then offers that the purpose of the chest is for "restoration". Gloria asks if that means things that were lost can be regained. 

Beryl then steps up to the box and asks for the restoration of the materials that were wasted in the experiment and for her pet Toughie to be back. A mechanical voice comes from the box saying that engery levels are below 20% and to confirm they want to drain all the energy. Cat looks on but doesn't say anything. Acambe suggests they evenly distribute the remaining uses. Agata wonders if there is enough energy to distribute for everyone's use. Beryl and Cocoa both comment they want to try it more. Agata suggests they let the victor make the final decision. MC asks what are the conditions to win? Agata proposes a match. Beryl wants to make the rules. Garcia complains that it's another competion and that they can't stick to the rules. Agata needles Garcia asking if Garcia doesn't want to participate or if she has nothing to wish for. Garcia gets mad. Maitha looks on but doesn't say anything. 

### Act II: Guarding Wishes 1

Homa calls MC "boss" and explains that in Hashalaram that's how they address employers, but it's also used to tease. Homa proposes to team up with MC. MC says the match is a solo showdown, but Homa says there isn't a rule that they can't strategize together. MC asks why Homa is helping him. Homa says it's Shahin's call. 

They participate in "The Great Magic Potion Battle" with Homa and her parrots assisting MC in the competion.  Samatha defeats Guzman. Miguel defeats Garcia. Gloria defeats Maitha. Cocoa and Acambe defeate each other. MC defeats Agata then Samantha, Miguel and Gloria. 

### Act III: Guarding Wishes 2

Miguel smells something awful. Cocoa spots a "tasty ingredient" moving on the ground. Beyrl says it's her pet chick and she is surprised it hatched. Miguel reveals the pet chick made a poo on him. Garcia jokes that Miguel is so maternal. Beyrl says the chick can join the next match.

The match is a potion battle with magical concoctions. Guzman, Cocoa and MC make up one team. Maitha, Garcia and Miguel make up another. In this battle Goli is able to steal effects from others, also Homa calls Goli a "her". Garcia defeats Cocoa. Miguel defeats Guzman. 

While fighting Maitha it's revealed that Homa can hear the thoughts of the parrots using a skill called perception. MC defeats Maitha.

Garcia teleports behind Miguel as if to attack him but she's just teasing and was just trying to cause a disruption. She teleports back. MC defeats Garcia.

Beryl releases her "Maid Wolf Mk II" into the field. MC uses perception on a wolf and finds out the were created to fight Calamity. When there is no Calamity Beryl forgets about them. Another wolf reveals they are in charge of cleaning the master's room but it never cleans rooms because it's the other wolves that make the mess. 

Using perception on Miguel MC finds out that while the chick smells bad he sort of likes it's fluffy touch. Miguel understands why Col likes fuzzy things. Miguel is defeated by MC and MC promises Goli cookies. 

Miguel tells Garcia she still lost the match. Garcia says she didn't join just to win. Cocoa notices that Beryl is no where to be seen. Agata says she saw Beryl head to Paradise. Samantha guesses she went to prepare something. MC notices Beryl has been missing since the start of the match. Homa appears and announces to everyone that Beryl has something important to tell them at Elysium. No one knows why, but Homa says judging by Beryl's expression it's not serious. 

### Act IV: Who's the prisoner!

Back at Paradise Beryl announces the winning team: Cocoa's team and Guzman scored a point. Cocoa asks Beryl where she went as Cocoa was chatting with her but then realized she was talking to Miguel. Beryl says she was getting ready for the next showdown but that she can't say what it is yet (this leads into Act IV which is time locked in-game). 

Everyone gathers in Paradise and talks among themselves in front of the wishing fridge. Beryl is looking for something. She announces that the parts for the wishing machine have been stolen. Beryl was taking the machine apart to learn more about it, but while putting it back together she noticed the power source was missing. 

Maitha wonders why Beryl was taking it aparg. Miguel hints that maybe Beryl took it, which Beryl denies. Everyone agrees they need to find the thief. Beryl mentions that she saw someone suspicous headed toward Elysium. The person was cloaked in black and wrapped up. Beryl reckons they were very smart and encourages everyone to go after them. Homa says the parrots have picked up on some strange traces. It's wheel tracks and footprints that do not belong to a human. The trail ends at the edge of Paradise, making Miguel suppose that the theif jumped into the Sea of Chaos. Everyone surmises it was a Calamity. Everyone leaves to set sail on the Sea of Chaos. Beryl is last and complains that she didn't get to set the rules yet. Whoever finds the parts first will score a point. But everyone has already left and Beryl is mad. She turns back to the Wishing Fridge and declares she will study it further. As Beryl looks into her bag she comments that she only hid one part but now there are 2 parts missing.  It appears Beyrl did hide the part but another part was really stolen as well. The Cat remains sleeping on the chair. 

### Act V: Seek the Truth 1

Miguel starts off saying that it's a dirty trick the theif is playing. They are saying that if they can't have it no one can, much how Miguel was in his past. Agata spots the tracks, but also comments that Beryl said a strage person was headed toward Elysium. MC says they should split up. Garcia is suspicious of Beryl. Cocoa says don't worry and to trust their instincts. Cocoa says she trusts Beryl so they should check on Elysium first. Gloria says they must catch the thief. 

Gloria, Miguel, Maitha, Samantha, Acambe and the MC are grouped together. Gloria says the traces led them there, but the trail has ended. Acambe says the place is eerie. Samantha says it seems they are far from Elysium. MC says this is a dimension fragment in the Sea of Chaos. Gloria says they should look for clues. Samantha agrees and says they should split up and search. Gloria recalls that before they left Beryl said whoever finds the part first scores a point. Miguel is surprised Beryl is still focused on the competition even with a part missing. 

Goli gives MC perception to solve the mystery.  MC goes around the map and surmises the part was stolen by Calamaties.  They took it to another place in the Sea of Chaos to summon a Colossal Calamity. MC goes to get the part. Maitha follows him silently.

### Act VI: Seek the Truth 2

Baloor the parrot says he got it.  MC asks "got what?". Baloor says Cocoa got it in Elysium. Gloria goes to check Elysium. Shahin appears with a note which is from Beryl and says that two parts are missing.  Whoever finds the missing part gets a point. MC comments that Maitha has been quiet today. Maitha appears and seems to know the MC is wondering about her.

MC appears on the map commenting that this area's scent is getting closer. Maitha appears and offers to help. Agata and Garcia appear looking for clues. Garcia complains Beryl is causing trouble. Agata tells Garcia it doesn't matter and they are in it so take it seriously. Garcia is annoyed at Agata's high and mighty seriousness.  They approach MC and offer to work together, but MC declines. 

MC talks to Maitha, but a strange force prevents MC from finding out what Maitha is thinking.

Calamaties appear. Agata, Garcia and Maitha are disabled. MC uses Baloor's skill to defeat the Calamities. 

MC investigates furhter and finds out the Calamities have figured out how to summon the Colossal Calamity.

### Act VII: Lost and Found

MC appears in a new area after having activated a mechanism and falling down. MC is confronted by many Calamities and calls on Baloor's power again. 

After defeating the Calamaties another shows up and vomits the parts up. Agata adn Garcia show up but are too late to claim the parts first.

Garcia is disappointed they couldn't find the parts first. Agata chides Garcia saying that Garcia cares about the competition. Garcia denies this. Agata says wanting to win isn't anything to be ashamed of and to just try your best. Garcia complains that Agata pat her head while saying such stuff.


### Act VIII: Ice Cracks

The group meets up at Paradise. Agata is laughing. Garcia is wondering why Agata is smiling when they lost the last round. Agata responds that Garcia must be enjoying it as well since she is also smiling. Samantha tells Garcia that she hasn't seen her this happy in a long time. Garcia becomes flustered and goes to check on the wishing machine set up progress. 

Beryl says she fixed up the wishing machine with the missing parts. Cocoa says they should check it now that it's fixed. Beryl says there's no need to check it and assures them it is fine. Cocoa notices that Beryl hasn't equipped it yet. Beyrl is silent. Garcia offers to help with the set up but Beryl declines. Beryl opens the machine and it appears to be functioning. She says she's just worried it will run out of energy if she installs it now. 

Gloria asks why the wishing machine is emitting cold air. Beryl tries to close the door but she can't and ends up pushing the wishin machine over the ledge into the Sea of Chaos. Cocoa is suprised and asks why Beryl did that. Beryl gets mad and says she wasn't trying to do that. Cocoa jumps over the ledge to get the machine. She if followed by Guzman and Maitha. 

As the others contemplate following Cocoa into the Sea of Chaos Beryl is in a panic saying she doesn't want to die yet. Agata asks Beryl if she knows something. Miguel notices the ice from the wishing machine is spreading and tells everyone to step back as it's freezing everything. But Beryl is stuck in the ice and she exclaims that she doesn't want to become an ice sculpture. Homa asks Beryl what happened. Homa's parrots circle Beryl. Beryl waves her arms around and suddenly everything is covered in ice. 

### Act IX: Saving Chaos 1

Garcia tells Beryl to tell them what's going on. Beryl says it's the wishing machine's fault. She tried to put it back together but it wouldn't accept the crucial part. She says the machine isn't a normal machine. It's more like a puppet. The MC says they should save Cocoa and Guzman and then think about fixing the machine. 

The group finds themselves in an area covered with ice. Samantha assures the MC that Cocoa and the others are probably looking for the machine so if they find the machine they should be able to meet up. Agata is excited at the challenges and mystery ahead of them. Calamities appear and Agata and Garcia defeat them. Agata and Garcia go off to fight other Calamaties while the rest fight the ones that appear on the map.  Homa calls in and has Shahin give the MC the haste ability to help with the ice. 

After the battle Agata and Garcia rejoin the group. Agata says the ice is getting thicker in one direction so that is where they should head. Acambe says he has a bad feeling about this but Agata reassures him that they have a reliable leader (the MC). The MC says they can't abandon Cocoa and the others. Samantha says they are with MC no matter what decision they make. Gloria agrees.
