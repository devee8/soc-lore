# A Fighting Night in Beryland ~Wishes Beyond the Void~

## Event Theater: Wondrous Fair

Homa is talking to MC in Elysium. Homa was sent by Beryl to get MC. She shows MC a message from Beryl that says "My scret hideout's open, just this once! Got loads of games ready! Lucky you, getting my invite." This is an invitation to Beryl's Paradise. Homa tells MC everyone is waiting and if they are ready to go. 

### Act I

MC arrives. In the group there is Cocoa, Maitha, Agata, Guzman, Acambe, Samantha, Garcia, Miguel, Beryl and Gloria. Cat is sleeping on a chair. Cocoa is standing in front of a chest wondering how there are theives in Elysium. The chest looks like a refrigerator. Garcia says theives are not surprising since there will always be people wanting to leech off others. Miguel asks why she is staring at him since he wouldn't want that junk anyway. Samantha asks Cocoa if she is sure she put the stuff in the safe. Cocoa says she is sure because only that chest can hold her iron pot. The iron pot was stolen. But then MC spots the pot. Miguel comments that he was almost blamed for something he didn't do. Beryl tells Cocoa not to worry since she often forgets stuff too, like if she's added ingredients or not. Cocoa says it's not her fault and that her pot was covered in old grease implying that this pot isn't hers. Miguel comments that who else but Cocoa would be carrying around a cauldron in Elysium. 

Cocoa then remembers that before she put the pot in the chest she said, "I want a new pot". She thinks the chest is magic just like at amusement parks. Miguel tells Cocoa to stop trying to fool everyone. Cocoa tells him to try it.  Beryl wants to try it out since it's not like it's going to explode.

Beryl takes a bottl of "Volcano Gurgle Secret Strenth Potion" that they used before and puts it into the chest. Garcia says that name is cheesy. Something happens in the chest and when they look at the bottle it's empty. Beryl is mad because she didn't ask for empty bottles. Cocoa thinks a bit and asks Beryl if it is possible the potion in the bottle went back to Beryl just like Cocoa's iron pot appeared on Cocoa's back. Beryl says that's not possible since it would explode if it touches the air. As she says this something explodes on Beryl and she runs around. Beryl is mad since the explosion hurt and she didn't want to get exploded. Garcia asks Beryl why her potion was so weak? Miguel comments that if it were stronger Beryl would have been done for today. 

From this Cocoa exclaims that the box really is magic, but it's a strange magic. Agata says it's still to early to say. Cocoa ask if anyone else wants to give it a shot. Gloria steps up to the box and asks for a plate of grilled fish. A plate of grilled fish comes out of the box. Beryl says she wants some too. MC asks if someone's stomach is growling. It was Gloria. She says that's strange since she just had grilled fish. Beryl concludes that the box must have taken the fish from Gloria's belly. Agata then offers that the purpose of the chest is for "restoration". Gloria asks if that means things that were lost can be regained. 

Beryl then steps up to the box and asks for the restoration of the materials that were wasted in the experiment and for her pet Toughie to be back. A mechanical voice comes from the box saying that engery levels are below 20% and to confirm they want to drain all the energy. Cat looks on but doesn't say anything. Acambe suggests they evenly distribute the remaining uses. Agata wonders if there is enough energy to distribute for everyone's use. Beryl and Cocoa both comment they want to try it more. Agata suggests they let the victor make the final decision. MC asks what are the conditions to win? Agata proposes a match. Beryl wants to make the rules. Garcia complains that it's another competion and that they can't stick to the rules. Agata needles Garcia asking if Garcia doesn't want to participate or if she has nothing to wish for. Garcia gets mad. Maitha looks on but doesn't say anything. 

### Act II: Guarding Wishes 1

Homa calls MC "boss" and explains that in Hashalaram that's how they address employers, but it's also used to tease. Homa proposes to team up with MC. MC says the match is a solo showdown, but Homa says there isn't a rule that they can't strategize together. MC asks why Homa is helping him. Homa says it's Shahin's call. 

They participate in "The Great Magic Potion Battle" with Homa and her parrots assisting MC in the competion.  Samatha defeats Guzman. Miguel defeats Garcia. Gloria defeats Maitha. Cocoa and Acambe defeate each other. MC defeats Agata then Samantha, Miguel and Gloria. 

### Act III: Guarding Wishes 2

Miguel smells something awful. Cocoa spots a "tasty ingredient" moving on the ground. Beyrl says it's her pet chick and she is surprised it hatched. Miguel reveals the pet chick made a poo on him. Garcia jokes that Miguel is so maternal. Beyrl says the chick can join the next match.

The match is a potion battle with magical concoctions. Guzman, Cocoa and MC make up one team. Maitha, Garcia and Miguel make up another. In this battle Goli is able to steal effects from others, also Homa calls Goli a "her". Garcia defeats Cocoa. Miguel defeats Guzman. 

While fighting Maitha it's revealed that Homa can hear the thoughts of the parrots using a skill called perception. MC defeats Maitha.

Garcia teleports behind Miguel as if to attack him but she's just teasing and was just trying to cause a disruption. She teleports back. MC defeats Garcia.

Beryl releases her "Maid Wolf Mk II" into the field. MC uses perception on a wolf and finds out the were created to fight Calamity. When there is no Calamity Beryl forgets about them. Another wolf reveals they are in charge of cleaning the master's room but it never cleans rooms because it's the other wolves that make the mess. 

Using perception on Miguel MC finds out that while the chick smells bad he sort of likes it's fluffy touch. Miguel understands why Col likes fuzzy things. Miguel is defeated by MC and MC promises Goli cookies. 

Miguel tells Garcia she still lost the match. Garcia says she didn't join just to win. Cocoa notices that Beryl is no where to be seen. Agata says she saw Beryl head to Paradise. Samantha guesses she went to prepare something. MC notices Beryl has been missing since the start of the match. Homa appears and announces to everyone that Beryl has something important to tell them at Elysium. No one knows why, but Homa says judging by Beryl's expression it's not serious. 

### Act IV: Who's the prisoner!

Back at Paradise Beryl announces the winning team: Cocoa's team and Guzman scored a point. Cocoa asks Beryl where she went as Cocoa was chatting with her but then realized she was talking to Miguel. Beryl says she was getting ready for the next showdown but that she can't say what it is yet (this leads into Act IV which is time locked in-game). 

Everyone gathers in Paradise and talks among themselves in front of the wishing fridge. Beryl is looking for something. She announces that the parts for the wishing machine have been stolen. Beryl was taking the machine apart to learn more about it, but while putting it back together she noticed the power source was missing. 

Maitha wonders why Beryl was taking it aparg. Miguel hints that maybe Beryl took it, which Beryl denies. Everyone agrees they need to find the thief. Beryl mentions that she saw someone suspicous headed toward Elysium. The person was cloaked in black and wrapped up. Beryl reckons they were very smart and encourages everyone to go after them. Homa says the parrots have picked up on some strange traces. It's wheel tracks and footprints that do not belong to a human. The trail ends at the edge of Paradise, making Miguel suppose that the theif jumped into the Sea of Chaos. Everyone surmises it was a Calamity. Everyone leaves to set sail on the Sea of Chaos. Beryl is last and complains that she didn't get to set the rules yet. Whoever finds the parts first will score a point. But everyone has already left and Beryl is mad. She turns back to the Wishing Fridge and declares she will study it further. As Beryl looks into her bag she comments that she only hid one part but now there are 2 parts missing.  It appears Beyrl did hide the part but another part was really stolen as well. The Cat remains sleeping on the chair. 

### Act V: Seek the Truth 1

Miguel starts off saying that it's a dirty trick the theif is playing. They are saying that if they can't have it no one can, much how Miguel was in his past. Agata spots the tracks, but also comments that Beryl said a strage person was headed toward Elysium. MC says they should split up. Garcia is suspicious of Beryl. Cocoa says don't worry and to trust their instincts. Cocoa says she trusts Beryl so they should check on Elysium first. Gloria says they must catch the thief. 

Gloria, Miguel, Maitha, Samantha, Acambe and the MC are grouped together. Gloria says the traces led them there, but the trail has ended. Acambe says the place is eerie. Samantha says it seems they are far from Elysium. MC says this is a dimension fragment in the Sea of Chaos. Gloria says they should look for clues. Samantha agrees and says they should split up and search. Gloria recalls that before they left Beryl said whoever finds the part first scores a point. Miguel is surprised Beryl is still focused on the competition even with a part missing. 

Goli gives MC perception to solve the mystery.  MC goes around the map and surmises the part was stolen by ities.  They took it to another place in the Sea of Chaos to summon a Colossal Calamity. MC goes to get the part. Maitha follows him silently.

### Act VI: Seek the Truth 2

Baloor the parrot says he got it.  MC asks "got what?". Baloor says Cocoa got it in Elysium. Gloria goes to check Elysium. Shahin appears with a note which is from Beryl and says that two parts are missing.  Whoever finds the missing part gets a point. MC comments that Maitha has been quiet today. Maitha appears and seems to know the MC is wondering about her.

MC appears on the map commenting that this area's scent is getting closer. Maitha appears and offers to help. Agata and Garcia appear looking for clues. Garcia complains Beryl is causing trouble. Agata tells Garcia it doesn't matter and they are in it so take it seriously. Garcia is annoyed at Agata's high and mighty seriousness.  They approach MC and offer to work together, but MC declines. 

MC talks to Maitha, but a strange force prevents MC from finding out what Maitha is thinking.

Calamities appear. Agata, Garcia and Maitha are disabled. MC uses Baloor's skill to defeat the Calamities. 

MC investigates furhter and finds out the Calamities have figured out how to summon the Colossal Calamity.

### Act VII: Lost and Found

MC appears in a new area after having activated a mechanism and falling down. MC is confronted by many Calamities and calls on Baloor's power again. 

After defeating the Calamities another shows up and vomits the parts up. Agata adn Garcia show up but are too late to claim the parts first.

Garcia is disappointed they couldn't find the parts first. Agata chides Garcia saying that Garcia cares about the competition. Garcia denies this. Agata says wanting to win isn't anything to be ashamed of and to just try your best. Garcia complains that Agata pat her head while saying such stuff.


### Act VIII: Ice Cracks

The group meets up at Paradise. Agata is laughing. Garcia is wondering why Agata is smiling when they lost the last round. Agata responds that Garcia must be enjoying it as well since she is also smiling. Samantha tells Garcia that she hasn't seen her this happy in a long time. Garcia becomes flustered and goes to check on the wishing machine set up progress. 

Beryl says she fixed up the wishing machine with the missing parts. Cocoa says they should check it now that it's fixed. Beryl says there's no need to check it and assures them it is fine. Cocoa notices that Beryl hasn't equipped it yet. Beyrl is silent. Garcia offers to help with the set up but Beryl declines. Beryl opens the machine and it appears to be functioning. She says she's just worried it will run out of energy if she installs it now. 

Gloria asks why the wishing machine is emitting cold air. Beryl tries to close the door but she can't and ends up pushing the wishin machine over the ledge into the Sea of Chaos. Cocoa is suprised and asks why Beryl did that. Beryl gets mad and says she wasn't trying to do that. Cocoa jumps over the ledge to get the machine. She if followed by Guzman and Maitha. 

As the others contemplate following Cocoa into the Sea of Chaos Beryl is in a panic saying she doesn't want to die yet. Agata asks Beryl if she knows something. Miguel notices the ice from the wishing machine is spreading and tells everyone to step back as it's freezing everything. But Beryl is stuck in the ice and she exclaims that she doesn't want to become an ice sculpture. Homa asks Beryl what happened. Homa's parrots circle Beryl. Beryl waves her arms around and suddenly everything is covered in ice. 

### Act IX: Saving Chaos 1

Garcia tells Beryl to tell them what's going on. Beryl says it's the wishing machine's fault. She tried to put it back together but it wouldn't accept the crucial part. She says the machine isn't a normal machine. It's more like a puppet. The MC says they should save Cocoa and Guzman and then think about fixing the machine. 

The group finds themselves in an area covered with ice. Samantha assures the MC that Cocoa and the others are probably looking for the machine so if they find the machine they should be able to meet up. Agata is excited at the challenges and mystery ahead of them. Calamities appear and Agata and Garcia defeat them. Agata and Garcia go off to fight other Calamities while the rest fight the ones that appear on the map.  Homa calls in and has Shahin give the MC the haste ability to help with the ice. 

After the battle Agata and Garcia rejoin the group. Agata says the ice is getting thicker in one direction so that is where they should head. Acambe says he has a bad feeling about this but Agata reassures him that they have a reliable leader (the MC). The MC says they can't abandon Cocoa and the others. Samantha says they are with MC no matter what decision they make. Gloria agrees. 

Miguel asks if we are really going to risk our lives for the worthless junk. He decides to leave the group and sit this one out. Garcia says that's not cool, but Garcia says he knows what his limit is. He gives MC his last fire bomb before he leaves. 

### Act X: Saving Chaos 2

We see Cocoa, Guzman and Maitha facing off against Calamities. The MC and others find them. Cocoa is touched that they cam to rescue them, but Garcia says they came for the wishing machine. Acambe and Gloria appear near the wishing machine. Cocoa warns them to stay away from it as a gust of cold air hits and pushes them into the wishing machine. Gloria and Acambe get absorbed into the machine. 

Homa contacts the MC and has Shahin give the MC the Haste and Push/Pull abilities.  MC uses Push/Pull to push a couple of Calamities over the edge. The group takes on the rest of the Calamities. 

The group determines they need to shut the wishing machine down. Beryl appears during the battle to fit the missing parts back into the machine. Beryl tries to put the parts back in but the wishing machine blowser her away. She leaves it up to the group to put the parts back.

A huge Calamity appears. Agata tells the MC to focus on the wishing machine while they focus on the Calamities. Samantha agrees. Maitha who has been silent comments that the Bond between these people is eviable. 

After placing the parts back into the wishing machine Gloria and Acambe reappear. Samantha and Agata rejoice. Garcia quips that Agata is still having fun. Agata asks Garcia how it feels fighting alongside her and teases that it's pretty good right? Garcia says Agata is talking crazy. Cocoa thanks everyone for rescuing them. Gloria echos that sentiment. 

Garcia asks where Beryl got blown off too and says she doesn't want to waste time rescuing her, but Samantha says Garcia really wants to save Beryl. Garcia denies this. Cocoa stands up for Beryl saying that even if Beryl made a mistake she still showed up to help and didn't run away. The MC says they should rescue Beryl and Cocoa agrees. 

A Calamity suddently appears, but Guzman steps in front of it and takes the hit, shielding the MC from harm. Garcia defeats the Calamity. Guzman is hurt. Garcia says she didn't know Guzman was so warm-hearted. Cocoa says it's her fault Guzman got hurt because she kept sending Guzman into battle. Samantha says not to worry. Guzman is not badly hurt, just too tired. Beryl shows up and apologizes. 

Now the wishing machine is functional again. Beryl says the rights to use it haven't been decided yet. The MC and Cocoa fixed up the wishing machine, but the MC says Guzman saved him so he gives up his claim to Guzman. The final will be between Guzman and Cocoa, but Cocoa comments about something about Guzman's daughter and wonders if she should continue. 

### Act XI: Imperfect Time and Space

Back at Paradise Beryl announces the next challenge is her favorite game: Statues. Cocoa steps up to say something, but Beryl interrupts and says she has upgraded the Statues game and she will also join. Cocoa says she will drop out of the challenge. Garcia says Cocoa must have realized how dull this contest is, but Cocoa says that's not it. She unconvincingly says she is just tired. Agata asks Cocoa if she's being bullied to quit. Cocoa says the thing is that she was planning to use Guzman from the start to help her win. She wanted to use the wishing machine to see her mom and dad. MC asks Cocoa why she's giving up now then? Cocoa says she has made it this far without her mom and dad and that Guzman needs the machine more than she does. She tells the others to stop trying to persuade her because she might change her mind as she wants to see her mom and dad. Samantha says her parents would be proud of her. Maitha says everyone will always be by her side. Agata is disappointed there will be no final showdown but respects Cocoa for her choice. 

Cocoa asks Guzman if he still remembers his wish. Guzman roars in response. Cocoa has placed the bow of Guzman's daughter into the machine and tells Guzman to make his wish. Guzman wishes his daughter would come back. A little girl walks out of the machine and Guzman calls out his daughter's name, Sascha. But Sascha things Guzman is a monster. Guzman tells her not to be scared and he won't come closer. He steps back. Sascha asks if he is really her dad. She has forgotten her dad's face, but remembers his hands. She remembers her dad would comb her hair and place her favorite red bow with his hands. She remembers her dad would hum lullabies next to her bed and let her ride on his shoulders. She says her dad said he would protect her for her whole life. Guzman becomes mad because he failed to protect her. Sascha says don't be mad and that she is scared. Guzman says okay. 

Maitha appears next to a Calamity and comments that is seems the people of this world view the Calamity as an enemy. Everyone except the MC, Maitha, the Calamity, Guzman, Sascha and the cat disappear. The cat asks the MC if he is spellbound. The MC asks if that is Maitha. The cat says the world has gone haywire and the MC hasn't noticed. The Cat says that if the MC doesn't correct things he will be stuck between fantasy and reality unable to tell them apart. MC asks if the wishing machine caused this. The Cat reminds the MC that no wish comes true so easily. To alter an outcome takes much effort and sacrifice. 

Sacha is talking to Guzman and asks him to tie up her hair.  The MC steps away and the Cat asks him if he is running away. The MC says he will head back to Elysium and rest first. It is perhaps to give Guzman more time to spend with Sascha. The Cat says the MC is either compassionate or indecisive. Guzman hugs Sascha.

### Act XII: Just a Dream

The MC is sleeping when Homa appears. Baloor wakes the MC by pecking on their head. Homa says Beryl sent them to get the MC for the paradise event. The MC asks if it's another event. Homa says it's the first one for her. It seems we are at the beginning of the story again. Was it just a dream?

MC walks around Elysim asking the others about the wishing machine. MC says that even if the wishing machine can't grant any more wishes they can still use it to store food. However the machine is nowhere to be found.

Homa: She says she is ready to go when MC is. 

Gloria: Says she also dreamt of the wishin machine. She made a wish to get Teadon a new set of kitcheware and Teadon made desserts for her. She also had a dream in her dream where they fought together to acheive an impossible goal. 

Garcia: Says she destroyed the wishing machine, but says that's a lie. She and Samantha wouldn't do that. 

Agata: Agata says she is looking forward to the competition. What matters to her is seeing everyone working hard together towards one goal, not the prize. Alexei's voice can be heard saying that he broke the weapon Agata had him work on. 

Miguel: Miguel doesn't know what this "wishing machine" is and it sounds as ridiculous as saying he could cook. Col's voice can be heard telling Miguel that she has made a mud pie feast. 

Samantha: Samantha says the MC looks a bit down. When asked about the wishing machine she doesn't know what that is. She says Elysium is cozy but deep down they all have regrets about their past. She says a wishing machine could make up for some things. 

Acambe: Says he had a dream last night that he created the perfect juice blend. The juice suited all tastes and made a hefty profit. When he woke up he couldn't remember the recipe.  MC asks if it was pomegranate juice. Acambe doesn't know and wants someone to do a dream divination for him. 

Cocoa: She is wondering what she should have for dinner. She asks MC what they want and says she's quite the chef. When asked about the wishing machine she doesn't know about it, but wonders if it can get her a new pot. 

Guzman: Is remembering the bow. The bow was worn and now it's gone. He lost Sascha's favorite bow. Guzman becomes mad. MC says he will find the bow and remembers he clearly saw Guzman had the bow before.

Maitha: Asks MC why they look troubled. She says MC can share heir troubles with her. She also doesn't know about a wishing machine. She says if one exists they shouldn't tell Boss (Rawiyah) and Faycal because Rawiyah would wish for a giant wine cellar and Faycal an oversized archery training ground.  Safiyyah's voice can be heard admonishing Rawiyah for passing out again and to go to bed to sleep. 

After talking to everyone MC goes to find other information.

Maitha appears and comments how this is a unique adventure unlike any other. She says she is impressed by everyone. The MC is confused. Maitha then says Beryl has invented a machine that grants wishes. MC asks if the machine has been found. Maitha asks if he found it and knew about it all along. MC says yes and the machine even granted Guzman his wish to see his daughter. Maitha is surprised at that and says don't let Guzman hear that or he will go berserk. Then Maitha says Beryl's Wish Machine isn't that powerful. Beryl's machine can give people a refreshing drink or a fluffy pillow. On mornings it has a special Calamity wake-up service.

MC comments that this wishing machine seems to be a service bot.  MC wonders if the other wishing machine will pop up again one day. 

### Interval I: Gear Master

Two Calamities are searching a house to find an object hidden by the Sorceress (likely Beryl). It's noted that the Sorceress likes to create mechanisms, but is forgetful and falls into her own traps. They plan to search her room for clues. They go through each room reading clues to get to the next.

We find that Zerel, Beyrl's old pet is considered "the discrace of the Calamities".

### Interval II: Thief Calamity

A lone Calamity makes its way through rooms without getting detected by guards.

### Interval III: The Hunt

MC is in the mines. Calamities are there. Goli sees they are shiny and gives MC the ability to gain abilities (Move Again and Steal).

### Interval IV: Parrot Training

MC is in a jail map. Homa says that MC doesn't seem to be in sync with Baloor. They have caught Calamities from the Sea of Chaos and put them in the jail. MC uses these to practice with Baloor. Balor gives MC and AoE skill.  The objective is to get through the Calamities and destroy the monument then escape by getting to the extraction point.

### Interval V: Go Go Maitha

The MC and Maitha appear on a map. They are looking for Cocoa's dropped package. They need to get to the package but Calamities appear and rocks separate MC and Maitha. MC gains Shahin's abilities Haste and Push/Pull.

When Maitha reaches the package Miguel shows up and kicks it so Maitha has to go back down. When Maitha finally reaches the package she finds Cocoa's diary.


### Interval VI: Guardian of Stars

The MC fights Calamities using Goli's Move Again and Steal ability.

### Interval VII: Calamity Training Camp

The MC is in the jail map again. Homa set up the map as a nother training scenario. MC must defeat the Calamities by destroying the monuments.  MC uses Charging Attack to defeat the Calamities.

### Interval VIII: Seize the Initiative

Maitha and MC encounter Calamities that are too tough to handle. They need to escape through a building on the other side of the map. Shahin gives MC the Haste and Push/Pull abilities to help Maitha get to the exit point.
