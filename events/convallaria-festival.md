### Act II: The Convallaria Festival Puzzle

MC is walking to Elysium from the dock. MC feels a chill down their spine. Maitha, Rawiyah and Faycal appear behind MC and suprise them with fireworks. Maitha welcomes MC back home. MC notices Elysium is decorated. Maitha says they decided to celebrate MC's safe return as that is what the convallaria flowers represent. 

In Elysium Rawiyah asks how MC likes the decorations. Faycal says that Magnus and Teadon put up the lights. Iggy and SchackLulu handled the cleaning. The decorations were done by Taair, Samantha and Gloria. Faycal chides Rawiyah that they said they would take care of the festival but they didn't do anything. Rawiyah says commanding is also a tough job and she has a surprise. NonoWill appears and does a flourish. Maitha says Rawiyah knows what is needed. Rawiyah says it's time to tell some tales with 500 barrels of super rye beer. She is eager to drink. 

Acambe appears. He is the sponsor of this year's Convallaria Festival. He says he has the authority to organize the event and has final say. Maitha wonders when Acambe became sponsor and why his face is printed on the ribbons. Acambe says it's because he's sponsor. Maitha asks how he can turn the Convallaria Festival into a commercial event. Taair, Iggy and SchackLulu appear behind Acambe. 

Acambe says he reached an agreement with the head of strategy for Elysium. The agreement says the ownership of the Elysium Convallaria Festival has been trasferred to Acambe. It is by Cat. Cat is the one that gave Acambe sponsor rights. MC inquires about how much Acambe paid Cat or if MC also gets a share. Acambe says MC's gift is ready as well. Acambe has prepared 4 riddles for this year's festival. Sovle the puzzle and receive a special gift. Faycal says it's one of those events when you spend coins and get a worthless prize. Faycal has seen merchants from other regions trick kids out of their money. Acambe doesn't deny this, but tells Faycal that Faycal has nothing better.

### Act III: Sweet Cooking I 

Riddle one is: Create a dish that makes everyone feel sweet.  NonoWill wonders if it's about sugar since it has to be sweet. Maitha says she things it has to do with heart since that will make those who eat it feel sweet and happy. Iggy says in a festival back with their tribe they had candied fruits. Iggy used to steal them to eat later. SchackLulu exclaims at how it was Iggy who stole the fruits Nono prepared for the ritual. Iggy didn't know Nono made them. No wonder they tasted good. SchackLulu tells Iggy that since he misses the tribe cooking he should cook with her today. 

MC, SchackLulu, Iggy, Beryl, Teadon, Magnus, Taair, Gloria, Samantha, NonoWill, Acambe, Rawiyah, Faycal and Maitha are at Elysium preparing to make candied fruit.

SchackLulu states the steps to make Mixed Candied Fruit. Peel and slice pears, oranges, apple and add honey. Put them in a pot, wait for the moisture to evaporate and the fruit to soften then coat them with honey. Iggy says without sister's special ingredients the fruits should not cause any stomach issues. 

They also need an oven, but the oven is broken. Rawiyah says Safiyyah probably broke it when making a cake because she puts everything into it. Beryl says she can act as the oven with her magic. SchackLulu tells Iggy to guard the fruits against bugs. 

MC goes to get apples, but the apples turn into Leilei the fruit killer. Leilei is a scorpion type monster. SchackLulu tells Iggy to get the bug before it gets to the fruits. They can't attack direclty though or it will damage the fruits. They need to use special traps. Iggy goes to defeat the scorpions before they can reach the fruit. 

Iggy gets the apples and gives them to MC. Another scorpion appears. Iggy traps that scorpion and gives the fruit to SchackLulu. SchackLulu cuts the fruit, but drops them on the ground. She says that's no problem.  She will add secret condiments. Iggy thinks to himself that he needs to remind everyone to not eat those.

More bugs appear. SchackLulu says she will get them, but Iggy tells her he will handle it because they need to make sure to keep the food clean. Iggy asks Beryl for help. Beryl conjures a barrel behind the scorpions. Iggy traps one scorpion and explodes the other. He gives SchackLulu the honey. SchackLulu completes the recipy. Maitha notices it's glowing. Iggy is worried. Teadon is suprised. NonoWill says it smells good. 

More scorpions show up. Beryl places more barrels. They get the igredients, give them to MC and create more candied fruit.

#### Act IV Interlude

SchackLulu asks if anyone wants candied fruits. Col appears. Iggy warns Col not to eat those. Col eats them anyway and says it's delicious. SchackLulu is suprised. Col says it's tastier than bugs. SchackLulu says Col is a good kid. Iggy is suprised and wonders if SchackLulu's cooking got better. He says they should all eat together. Maitha, Gloria, Taair and SchackLulu do not seem to like what they ate. Thee can only say "hmm..." MC asks what's wrong and tries some. Iggy says he can't (open his mouth) MC says their teeth are also stuck. Faycal asks what is everyone doing. No one can speak since their teeth are stuck together. Faycal goes to get a potion from Beyrl to dissolve the candied fruit. 

Once the candied fruit is dissolved Iggy says they were worried their teeth would always be stuck. Maitha askes SchackLulu what she put in the candied fruit. SchackLulu says she added a gum that helps to quickly coat the fruit in syrup. Iggy notes she used a dozen bottles, too much. 

Acambe says it looks like everyone has realized candied fruit wasn't the answer to his puzzle. Maith says maybe the key is to create a sense of sweetness. She says they should start out with the symobolic food. Gloria says since it's the Convallaria Festival they shouldn't miss out on Convallaria Cake. MC says that will be difficult. Gloria says that Teadon can do it. Apparently Teadon is a master chef. 

### Act V: Sweet Cooking II 

Teadon, Gloria, Maitha and MC are in Elysium preparing to make Convallaria Cakes. Gloria mentions that during the Convallaria Festival in town (during Spirals of Destiny) Maitha taught her how to make different types of Convallaria Cakes. Gloria doesn't remember much other than Convallaria Cake is the sweetest treat she's had. Teadon says he has already asked Maitha for the recipe and that he and Maitha have improved upon it. Maitha says the new recipe is more complex but now they can make even more Convallaria Cakes with a pleasant sweetness. In addition they can hide surprises in the cakes. Maitha says the ingredients for Convallaria Cake are flour, honey, butter and eggs. First you mix the ingredients then you knead the dough and press it in the mould. Finally bruch a layer of egg wash on the dough and put it in the oven. 

Before they can mix the ingredients Purpurus appear and eat them. Teadon says according to the monster guide Purupurus don't immediately digest the food they eat. If they defeat the Purupurus they can get the ingredients back. However they need to make sure to be careful or the ingredients might mix with the Purupuru digestive juices. 

The group uses the traps they used on the scorpions to catch the Purupurus.  Unfortunately Maitha and Gloria's traps get entangled. MC holds of the Purupurus while they sort things out. Wolves also appear. 

After defeating the monsters Teadon prepares the dough for the Convallaria Cakes. He asks MC what shape to make them: Purupuru, Teadon or Convallaria shaped. 

#### Act V Interlude 

After Act V Col appears and says the cakes are delicious. Iggy says everything tastes good to Col. Maitha says this recipe is low sugar and the sweetness is just right. Plus the smell of butter and honey is rich but not greasy. Taair comments on the taste and says he can almost feel the atmosphere of the Convallaria Festival he remembers from town. Gloria says it's the power of food. MC says each flavor is unique. Faycal comments that something strange is in the cake. Iggy wonders if it's a bug. Col says bugs are food too. MC reads a note that says "I hope those that each the cakes find happiness". Taair reads one that says "at the dock you can always find someone to watch the stars with you". Faycal reads on that says "Let's see this through to the end" and wonders who wrote those. Iggy reads one that says, "The winds of happiness will always reach Elysium". It was Maitha who collected those quotes and placed the notes in the cakes. She says if you eat a cake you might see something you once said. Faycal looks less than enthusiastic. Iggy is excited to see what others say about the cakes. Col reads a note, "I love this place. It's great to be with everyone". Col says that's the same as she feels. Gloria offers MC another cake. The MC reads, "Hope everyone can be healthy and strong" and "For health! Come on! I'll be waiting near the swings for our night run!" Iggy decides they should just forgett about the notes. Acambe says nothing.
