# Luxite Experiments

Luxite experiments are experiments done with Luxite.  Most notably experiements in combining Luxite and humans.

Tranquillo of the Darklight is known to conduct horrible Luxite experiments that mutate and mutilate subjects, often with deadly results.

While most do not survive the Luxite experiements there are a few that are known to have survived.

## Beryl

[Beryl](../characters/beryl.md) was experimented on as a young child.  The experiments stunted her physical and mental growth but otherwise left Beryl relatively unscathed.

## Guzman

[Guzman](../characters/guzman.md) underwent Luxite experiments as an adult. After the experiments he no longer resembled his former human self and much of his humanity was lost.

## Momo

The Luxite experiments left [Momo](../characters/momo.md) with visible physical scars and transformations.  It may have also affected her mind.
